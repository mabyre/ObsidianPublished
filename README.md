## Projects

Here I add a page to describe projects

Obsidian internal link **\[\[ ]]** transformed into :

https://mabyre.github.io/ObsidianPublished/Projects.html

by the plugin Git publisher

[Projects](./Projects.md)

Markedown link direct acces to **.md** page

[Projects](https://mabyre.github.io/ObsidianPublished/Projects)

Obsidian link :

obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=Check%20List

## Conclusion

Fortunately it's not every day that we come across something so useless !

I swear I wrote pages with Obsidian that I never managed to transfer here !
